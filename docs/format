The code for bookmark export is located in
android/src/org/coolreader/crengine/BookInfo.java

Here's a quick recap:

1.  the file's encoding is UTF-8, with BOM. It uses CRLN line terminators;

2.  the file starts with a header of the following format:

        # Cool Reader 3 - exported bookmarks
        # file name: %filename%
        # file path: %path to file%
        # book title: %book's title%
        # author: %book's authors%
        # series: %series' info%

    There is a single empty line after the header;

3.  only comments and corrections are being exported;

4.  the position and the type of bookmark is dumped:

        ## %pos% - comment
    or
        ## %pos% - correction

    %pos% is of format %.2f%% (see printf(3));

5.  if section title is present, the following line is emitted:

        ## %title%

    In practice, it seems like the title is never absent, but it might be empty;

6.  if some text was selected for a bookmark, the following line is emitted:

        << %text%

    In practice, *the only way* to create a bookmark is to select some text, so
    I can't see any way for that field to be empty;

7.  if there is a comment for this bookmark, the following line is emitted:

        >> %comment%

    In practice, if user didn't supply eny comment, empty line is used insted of
    it;

8.  the file ends with an empty line.
